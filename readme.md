# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This simple calendar application allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. It runs in the browser and is powered
by jQuery and Day.js. It relies on localStorage to save any entered data and set it on page load.

For this challenge we were provided with the following acceptance criteria:

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

## Roadmap

- Add a reset button that clears out all data in local storage
